DIY Configurable USB/HID Morse Code Interface
=========================================

Introduction
---------------

DIY Configurable USB Morse Code Interface for LCWO, PCWFistCheck, VBand, MorseMania etc. In collaboration with the [Online Configurator](https://www.pe1hvh.nl/cw_online_configurator/) , this interface allows you to use your favorite Morse key with various programs and apps, instead of relying on a mouse or keyboard.

Please note that not all browsers support WebUSB. Refer to the Browser Support section in this Readme doc for more information.


How it works
------------
When the interface is connected to a USB port, the interface program waits for an initial key press (from the Morse key).

- If this key press lasts less than 2 seconds, the interface program will proceed with either the default values or the configuration values specified using the online configurator.
- If it lasts longer than 2 seconds, the program will wait for a connection with the Online Configurator.

The Online Configurator will prompt you to select the correct USB device/port (in this case, the Seeeduino XIAO).

Once the connection is established, you can specify the type of Morse key and configure the interface for:

- Mouse emulation, or
- Keyboard emulation.

Depending on the chosen emulation mode, you can assign actions such as the right/left mouse button or the right/left Ctrl key.

To stop the configuration process (donÂ´t forget to send the new configuration to the XIAO):

- Press the Morse key briefly, or
- Close the Online Configurator.

The configuration will be stored in the interface's permanent memory.


Hardware/STL File
-----------------

This project only needs a micro jack, some wire, a USB-C/USB cable, and of course a Seeeduino XIAO SAMD21.

For this project, pins 6,7 and ground are used.

The STL files for the 3D-printed Seeeduino case can be found on [morse-code-usbhid-interface-the-gadget](https://hackaday.io/project/184702-morse-code-usbhid-interface-the-gadget).

Visual Code and PlatformIO
-------------------------

For this project, I used Visual Studio Code as the IDE with the PlatformIO plugin. PlatformIO requires functions to be declared before they are called in the code. This is because PlatformIO uses a more standard C++ compilation process, which strictly adheres to the requirement that functions must be declared before use.

For using the Arduino IDE, the code is converted and placed in a separate folder in this repository. See the Arduino IDE paragraph for more details.


SonarLint
---------

For writing clean code, the SonarLint plugin is installed in Visual Studio Code. SonarLint is an open-source code analysis tool that helps developers write cleaner, safer, and higher-quality code. While it's not necessary to use all SonarLint rules, the most important ones are enabled.

ArduinoIDE
----------
This code is converted to be compatible with the Arduino IDE and is placed in the arduino_ide folder as an Arduino project.

To add Seeeduino XIAO to your Arduino IDE:
1. Click on File > Preferences
2. Fill "Additional Boards Manager URLs" with the following URL: https://files.seeedstudio.com/arduino/package_seeeduino_boards_index.json
3. Use your library manager to install the following libraries:
- Keyboard
- Mouse
- Simple Web Serial (confirm to install dependencies too, if asked)
- Arduino_Json
- FlashStorage_SAMD

Browser support
---------------

The Online Configurator will work with the following browsers:
- Chrome: Fully supports WebUSB since version. It also supports Web Serial API.
- Edge: Supports WebUSB since version.
- Opera: Supports WebUSB.
- Android browsers: Chrome for Android fully supports WebUSB.

Firefox doesn't support WebUSB or Web Serial API yet


OS support
----------

It will work with the following desktop operating systems:
- Windows (>= 8.1)
- macOS
- Linux
- ChromeOS

You can use the interface with your smartphone, but you cannot use the online configurator on your smartphone.


Notes and Warning
-----------------

While the Morse code interface uses the Keyboard.print() or Keyboard.press() command, the Arduino board takes over your keyboard! Make sure you have control before you use the command.
